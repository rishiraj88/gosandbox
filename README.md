# Golang
A dedicated repository (playground as well) of programs and apps to demonstrate the capabilities of Golang (Go language), including:
- language fundamentals out of the box, and
- RESTful API development.

## Notes
- More Go artifacts are to be published next week as the current week has been celebrating TypeScript.
- Alongside C++ or C# code listings may compe up to 'C' and join (think '++') the party-GOer. A humorous take on the Programming Language clan about celebrating togethernees.
